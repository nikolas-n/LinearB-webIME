[Mycenaean Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greek) script [Linear B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B) input method.

A quick fork of an input method for chinese used to input the syllabograms of Linear B, the earliest form of Greek.

You may also find another online transliterator for Linear B, which I have made, [here](https://github.com/nikolas-n/LinearB-transliterator), hosted [here](http://linear-b.kinezika.info).
